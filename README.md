## 📊 Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key supply chain metrics such as:

- **OTIF (On Time In Full)**: Measures deliveries that are on time and complete.
- **IFR (In Full Rate)**: Tracks the percentage of orders delivered in full.
- **OT (On Time Delivery)**: Measures timeliness of order fulfillment.
- **LIFR (Line Fill Rate)**: Tracks the completeness of individual order lines.
- **VOFR (Volume Fill Rate)**: Measures the proportion of volume delivered vs ordered.

## 📍 Key Sections

### 1. **Top Metrics Cards**
- High-level KPIs for OTIF, IFR, OT, LIFR, and VOFR.

### 2. **Split by Cities**
- Compares KPIs (OTIF, IFR, OT) across different cities.

### 3. **Filters Panel**
- Interact with the dashboard using filters such as:
  - `Customer Name`
  - `Product Name`
